CRITERIA
MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
The user can create a canvas of any (reasonable) size.
Entering whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, causes an empty grid to appear on the page.

The user can color the pixels in the grid.

Choosing a color from the color selector and clicking on a grid square causes that grid square (and only that square) to change color.

Event listeners are properly added to the grid squares (and not to the border or the table itself).

The user can reset the grid to a blank state.

If there are already colored squares in the grid, clicking the Submit button clears them out.
